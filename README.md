# What is this?
As part of the final project for one of my courses, I implemented a coding project that involved using a doubly linked list circular data structure. The objective was to demonstrate the understanding and application of circular doubly linked lists in real-world scenarios. By utilizing this data structure, I was able to create an efficient and versatile system for managing and manipulating data. The project showcased the benefits of bidirectional traversal, the ability to form an infinite loop, and the versatility of the circular doubly linked list in handling various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of data structures and their practical implementation, specifically with the circular doubly linked list, contributing to a successful outcome in the course's final assessment.

## Double Linked List Circular
A doubly linked list circular, also known as a circular doubly linked list, is a variation of the doubly linked list where the last node's next pointer points back to the first node, and the first node's previous pointer points to the last node. This creates a circular structure, forming a closed loop.

In a doubly linked list circular, all the nodes are connected in a circular manner, allowing for continuous traversal in both forward and backward directions. The circular nature of the list provides some unique properties and benefits.

The key characteristics of a doubly linked list circular are:
 - `Circular Structure`: The last node's next pointer points to the first node, and the first node's previous pointer points to the last node, creating a circular loop.
 - `Bidirectional Traversal`: You can traverse the list in both forward and backward directions, starting from any node in the list.
 - `Infinite Loop`: Since the last node points back to the first node, you can continue traversing the list indefinitely without reaching an end.

The circular structure of the list offers advantages in certain scenarios, such as implementing circular queues or circular buffers. It allows for efficient rotation and cycling of elements in a continuous manner.

However, when working with a circular doubly linked list, it's important to handle the circular connections properly to avoid infinite loops during traversal or modification operations. Special care should be taken when inserting or deleting nodes to maintain the integrity of the circular structure.

Overall, a doubly linked list circular provides the benefits of bidirectional traversal and the ability to form an infinite loop, making it suitable for applications where cyclic behavior or continuous looping is desired.
